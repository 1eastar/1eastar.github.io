Hi! I am a M.S. student at [DLI Lab](https://diyonsei.notion.site/) advised by [Jinyoung Yeo](https://jinyeo.weebly.com/). Previously, I received B.S. in Computer Science from Yonsei University in Feb. 2024.

My recent research interests include: (i) Reasoning and Planning to solve long-horizon tasks and (ii) Embodied AI with a strong understanding of real-world dynamics. Additionally, I focus on analyzing language models (LMs) to identify limitations and room for improvement. The ultimate goal of my research is to design systems that enable humans to communicate and interact with AI in a trustworthy and beneficial manner.

Topics of interest

Reasoning and Planning: Think-and-Execute, RewardMATH
Embodied AI:
Analysis of LMs: Preference Bias, Cactus, RewardMATH
